Exercise 6: (2) Create an interface with at least one method, in its own package. Create a
class in a separate package. Add a protected inner class that implements the interface. In a
third package, inherit from your class and, inside a method, return an object of the
protected inner class, upcasting to the interface during the return.
Exercise 7: (2) Create a class with a private field and a private method. Create an
inner class with a method that modifies the outer-class field and calls the outer-class method.
In a second outer-class method, create an object of the inner class and call its method, then
show the effect on the outer-class object.
Exercise 8: (2) Determine whether an outer class has access to the private elements of
its inner class.


Exercise 10: (1) Repeat the previous exercise but define the inner class within a scope
within a method.
Exercise 11: (2) Create a private inner class that implements a public interface. Write
a method that returns a reference to an instance of the private inner class, upcast to the
interface. Show that the inner class is completely hidden by trying to downcast to it.
