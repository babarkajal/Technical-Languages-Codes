/*
 Program 1: Write a Program to check whether the entered number is Strong
Number or Not.
{Note: A number can be termed as strong number; if the sum of factorials of
each digit from that number is equal to that number, itself. e.g. 145 is a Strong
Number since 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.}
Input: 145
Output: 145 is a Strong Number.
