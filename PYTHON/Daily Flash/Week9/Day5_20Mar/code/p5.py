Program 5: Write a Program that accepts N numbers from user and calculates Variance of those numbers.
{Steps: we can calculate Average of numbers using following formula.
Variance (v) = âˆ‘(x-a)^2 / n
Where,
    X are numbers entered,
    A is average of those numbers
    n is count of those numbers }
Input:
    Enter Value N: 3
    Enter Values: 1 5 2
Output:
    Average (a) of Numbers = 1.5
    Variance of Numbers: 2.89
